# Regalo
Regalo is a web application for exchanging unwanted gift cards between users.

**DESCRIPTION:**

  It is a student project created and developed to demonstrate and become
  accustomed to the practices and strategies used in developing a concept

  are computer science majors at Trinity College and decided to make this
  web application for purely educational and experimental purposes.
